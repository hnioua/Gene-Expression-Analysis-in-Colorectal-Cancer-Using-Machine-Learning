# 🔬 Gene Expression Analysis in Colorectal Cancer Using Machine Learning  

This project explores the **gene expression patterns in colorectal cancer** using **machine learning algorithms** to classify tissue samples as cancerous or healthy. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains **804 observations** with multiple gene expression values.  

## 📌 Objectives  
- Analyze gene expression data to identify **potential biomarkers**.  
- Develop predictive models to classify tissue samples.  
- Compare different **machine learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and data splitting.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying important genes using feature importance techniques.  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Comparing performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 📊 Results  
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (90.1%), followed by **SVM (88.5%)**.  
- Identified **key genes** contributing to colorectal cancer classification.  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Implementing **deep learning models** (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs).  
- Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
